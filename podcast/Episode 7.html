Welcome to Geocaching in Sydney, an irregular podcast about my geocaching adventures in the greater Sydney area. My name is Edwin, I play this game under the name of Team MavEtJu which includes my kids and everybody else who is with me at that moment.

Today's adventure happened in and near Blakehurst, a suburb north of the Georges river. I had to drop somebody off at Oatley earlier and on my way back I realized that there have been three caches deployed in the last month or so, enough for me to make a side trip on my way back. After some traditionals in the Connells Capers series by Nessell I finally collected the container and log for Key Ring Circus, a 2003 multicache by Black Beard's Pirates. I started walking the boardwalk into Poulton Park Wetlands and got to about 50 meters to the GZ and was near a beautiful lake. These last 50 meters were a serious obstacle and it was all water and mud so I walked back over the boardwalk and did a little bit of bushbashing from the street towards GZ. Unfortunately the Black Beard's Pirates have stopped playing in 2009 or so and the box is in serious need of maintenance. After I logged it I got pinged by Wazza9 asking for the location details since he is keen on adopting, officially or not, these old ones. Keep up the good work Wazza9!

The cache is called Stuart Park, but the official name for it is Stuart Street Reserve. It was part of original 120 acres granted to William Fitzpatrick. The land was purchased by Father John Joseph Therry in 1837. In 1877 most of this land was subdivided and auctioned as the Georgeton (sometimes Georgetown) Estate.

In 1917, Kogarah City Council purchased seven allotments fronting Joseph Street, and the Joseph Street reserve was used as a football ground in the winter grounds, with a cricket pitch installed in 1931. In 1947 it was leased out to the Department of Main Roads and was returned to Kogarah City Council until 1953 when the reserve was renamed Stuart Street Reserve, reflecting the change of street names.
