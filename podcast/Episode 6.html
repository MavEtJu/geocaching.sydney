Welcome to Geocaching in Sydney, an irregular podcast about my geocaching adventures in the greater Sydney area. My name is Edwin, I play this game under the name of Team MavEtJu which includes my kids and everybody else who is with me at that moment.

Today's recording was from the area around Salt Pan Creek at Riverwood, where ziggiau held her third International Geocaching Day event. Her previous events were held at Cook Park on the shores of Botany Bay at Dolls Point. This year there was much less wind, which was appreciated by everybody!

About a year ago I parked the car in a side street of Beverly Hills and took my bicycle to do the "Just keep walking" series by ziggiau. She is living in this area so a lot of the caches here are hers. When I got the sixth one I realized I was close to Salt Pan Creek park, a beautiful park with playgrounds and water features near some community centers. The three caches there, conveniently called "Salt Pan Creek 1", two and three, are all trolls: caches under bridges. Today I was lucky to find a previous DNF on the first one, while helping others on finding the second one.

Salt Pan Creek has its own ghost wandering around!

What is next on the agenda? Calypso62 is holding his tenth "Coffee, Cakes and Conundrums" puzzle evening on Monday the 25th of September at Galston, north of Sydney. For the people in southern Sydney, I"m holding the Sutherland Shire Geocaching Puzzle Solving Night on Thursday the 28th of September at Sutherland. I hope to see you at one of them!
