Welcome to Geocaching in Sydney, an irregular podcast about my geocaching adventures in the greater Sydney area. My name is Edwin, I play this game under the name of Team MavEtJu which includes my kids and everybody else who is with me at that moment.
</p><p>
The inspiration for this podcast came from my fascination of radio documentaries in which people travel through a town or city and explain what it is they are seeing or what they are doing. Together with the background sounds it creates the beautiful environment which the story gets told in.

About geocaching. I'm a rather fanatic player, I play both on the Groundspeak geocaching.com and the Geocaching Australia listing services. I maintain about one hundred caches in the Sutherland Shire and Illawara area, including a puzzle trail in Helensburgh. On the Geocaching Australia site I maintain two huge series of virtuals, the first one is the lighthouses of Australia series with the locations of about 175 lighthouses in it. The second one is the Engineers Australia Historic Markers series with about 190 historically significant buildings, bridges or constructions. Besides finding and placing caches, this hobby expands to the development of Geocube, my geocaching app. It works with both the Groundspeak goecaching.com website and the Geocaching Australia website in one app, so I don't have to look at multiple locations for which I want to find!

My hobbies besides geocaching are my children (best longterm project I've had), walking (which goes very well with my geolocation hobbies), and hacking and tinkering away on my computer and electronics.

This episode's adventures took place in St Leonards in the northern Sydney area. Let's go to the first one, 'Lost Ball' by Sampaimasa.

I was in St Leonards to pick up a digital oscilloscope for my computer and since it hadn't been an area I've been before, there were enough caches available. The first one I found was the trigpoint on top of the St Leonard's Catholic Church, a beautiful old building with a very tall and sharp tower. The church spire is the point to look at. The second cache, which we just listened to, is at Talus reserve next to the Northern Suburbs Tennis Association. A little bit creepy so close to the tennis court fences ("just ignore me while you are playing!") as the GPS drifts under the tree cover, the container is about five meters away from the fences. The third one is named Naremburn Park by Pizza_Steve, a little bit north at Naremburn Park itself.

The last ones are at the Gore Hill. From Naremburn Park you cross the railroad line towards the Royal North Shore Hospital and the past it. I didn't go through the main gate as the Gore Hill cache from Richary had to be found first. Gore Hill cemetery was used between 1877 and 1974 and contains about 14 500 bodies. As usual all faiths are here but each has their own section. Because it has been unused for so long, nature has taken over quite a bit, which makes it even more visually attractive. I like this style, it's how the memory of the people gone will fade away into nothing and everything will go back to the way nature wants it. The last cache here was "In Loving Memory" by Nilbog_Aus, placed in 2007.

So far for my adventures in St Leonards, it will be a long time before I will be back again here.

What is next on the agenda? Geocaching Australia has just finished its xmas in July winter game, see the forums at geocaching.com.au for who has won. Groundspeak is running their "The Lost Treasure of Mary Hyde" game this month, so that will keep people busy also (but not as busy as the Geocaching Australia game where you had to find 25 GCA listed caches). On 19 August there is an international Geocaching day event at Salt Pan Reserve hosted by ziggiau. Salt Pan Reserve is at Riverwood, between Punchbowl and Padstow. On 20 August is the AGM of GeocachingNSW at Carlingford, see geocachingnsw.asn.au for more details. I hope to see you at one of them!
