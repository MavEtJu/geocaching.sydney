Welcome to Geocaching in Sydney, an irregular podcast about my geocaching adventures in the greater Sydney area. My name is Edwin, I play this game under the name of Team MavEtJu which includes my kids and everybody else who is with me at that moment.

Today's adventure happened in the forest between Loftus and Engadine. While going for a small traditional cache, I ended up in a post-backburn area!

It was surely easier to walk up the hill this way, the lack of sticks and branches with leaves to walk around made it a quick one. On the way back down I got disturbed by a pack of kookaburras discussing the recent changes in the landscape.
