Welcome to Geocaching in Sydney, an irregular podcast about my geocaching adventures in the greater Sydney area. My name is Edwin, I play this game under the name of Team MavEtJu which includes my kids and everybody else who is with me at that moment.

Todays adventure wasn't in the greater Sydney area, but on the road between Canberra and Cooma. When you are on the road, you are in the ACT, but when you are on the railroad line parallel to the road, about 30 meters to the east, you are in New South Wales. The railroad is the former Michelago branch of the Bombala railway line, established in 1887 and closed in 1988.

The first cache was the Royalla Railway Station. Royalla is a small rural town on the east of the railroad line, but on the right hand side it has, in 2014, the largest solarfarm with more than 83 thousand solarpanels. Since the railway line is unused, everything is very rusty. But as usual it's very exciting walking on the track and seeing all the levels and switches close up.

Three hundred meters to the south is the Royalla Railway cache. At the bridge to the south the railroad is a single track, this cache is at the levers which allows to switch from a single track to a double track.

A couple of kilometers to the south is the railroad bridge over Deep Creek. It is really exciting to walk under such an old bridge.
