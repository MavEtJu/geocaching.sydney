Welcome to Geocaching in Sydney, an irregular podcast about my geocaching adventures in the greater Sydney area. My name is Edwin, I play this game under the name of Team MavEtJu which includes my kids and everybody else who is with me at that moment.

Today's adventure happened on the beach in Cronulla, east in the Sutherland Shire. The walk went from Wanda beach in the direction of Boat Harbour. You can walk either via the beach itself or on Bate Bay road which is a path about 300 meters of the beach.

Wanda is an Aboriginal word for sand hills and Cronulla comes from the Aboriginal word kurranulla, which means place of the pink seashells. The sand dunes are a curiousity in the area as all other sea borders are cliffs. Before the dunes were there, the exits of the current George's river, Cook's river and Towra River all went out via an outlet at current Wanda beach, while Kurnell was an island in the stream. However, the outlet became blocked due to accumulating sand and sediment and the rivers found a new exit north near La Perouse and the island of Kurnell became connected to the Cronulla area. You can find more information, including the effects of the sand mining happening in these dunes, on the Wikipedia page about the Cronulla Sand Dunes.

The mentioned GeoKrety are like travelbugs but not associated with a specific listing service. Unless Groundspeak specific travelbug codes which you can only purchase if you are a reseller for their goods, GeoKrety codes are available for free and you can put them on your own travelbugs. This was the first GeoKret I found in Australia.

What is next on the agenda? Groundspeak is running their last week of the "The Lost Treasure of Mary Hyde" game.

There are two in Bowral, one but Muppet95 and one by 154 Crows. And there is one in Rhodes near the Parramatta river by RangerD and JoPS87.
